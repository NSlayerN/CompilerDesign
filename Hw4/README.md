In this HomeWork we have to write a grammer for password generation
In **Pass.g4** file you can see that our password must have at least **8 characters.**
this characters must contain at least a symbol ( @#$%^....) and a capital letter 
and we cant use spaces in password.

after writing python code with importing PassLexer.py
you can see 2 diffrent output in pictures :

True password:
![True](https://github.com/NSlayerN/CompilerDesign/assets/135645486/05e2dadf-7e60-4812-aa83-ad0a697b7217)

False password:

![sshot-1](https://github.com/NSlayerN/CompilerDesign/assets/135645486/6369edc2-e847-4051-91c9-483a2bff9044)

and you can see parse tree in below :
