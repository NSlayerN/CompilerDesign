first of all we write a grammer "homework3.g4"
we want to get email,url,postalcode,float,versionofsoftware and national number and recognize them
and show them in parse tree 

**as you can see we can see our input in parse tree :**
![sshot-1](https://github.com/NSlayerN/CompilerDesign/assets/135645486/c10ae09c-3adc-4095-92e2-d5cd43439fd4)

after that we have to generate grammer to have parser and lexer files :
![Generate is done](https://github.com/NSlayerN/CompilerDesign/assets/135645486/6caaba89-329a-4a28-aa1d-be86b330166b)

after generate we have to push all commits and files to this directory

i also added readme and input file(that contain inputs in first picture) to directory.

read commits for more information
